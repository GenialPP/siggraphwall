SIGGRAPH Image Wall
===================

> Let's try to make a image wall for SIGGRAPH (2013) technical papers!

Motivation
----------
[SIGGRAPH][1] is really great, and those published technical papers keeps pushing it to the un-explored limit.
It is easy to get a list of great work through [official website][1].
However, if you don't like to wait til the last minute,
you can visit [Ken-Sen Huang's collection (ex, for SIG'13)][4] frequently and get surprised.
You can get something really refresh there, and study papers prior to attending the conference.

[This year][2], there is a compilation of the 1st page of all technical papers,
[Technical Papers First Pages][3].
I think it would be great to have a image wall, a pinterest-like website,
which dedicates to provide ease-to-read, inspiring and a ToC-like functionality.

I need your help.



Goal
----

* An image wall of technical papers in nearly all SIGGRAPH or other related conferences.
* As easy as possible to browse for human beings and to parse for machine programs.
* No license issues or copyright conflict/fight for using.
* Coop with other great ideas or similar services to help inspiring research in
  computer graphics and computer vision fields.
* Be friendly.



Task
----
* First and the most important one, to figure out the suitable license for this work.
  I don't like to get into trouble like [this][5] or make issues to people providing help.
  Right now, I use [CC0, Public Domain Dedication][6].
* Secondly, I need your help :)
* To extract paper titles, and apply to name those extracted teaser images.
* Being lack one teaser image of the title ""
* To compile a human-friendly and machine-readable format of papers.
  I think [BibJSON][7] should be a great choice.
* To build a pinterest-like website for human browsing and machine parsing.
